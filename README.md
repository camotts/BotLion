# BotLion
Southeastern Louisiana University Discord Bot

## Prerequisites
We use Dep as out package manager. You can install it via `go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep`

The source and any documentation can be found at their [github](https://github.com/golang/dep)
## Commmands
### ++google-it
This command is used primarily when answering questions. If you're pretty sure that the user didn't first use google to find their answer, simply type `++google-it <query/>`. This will cause the bot to send a very helpful instructional on how to use the Google search engine. The user will then be redirected to google.com with the appropriate search.
